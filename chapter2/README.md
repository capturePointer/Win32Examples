# Chapter 2 - An Introduction to Unicode

### Unicode
Unicode is an extension of ASCII character encoding. Rather than the 7 bitse used to represent each character in strict ACII,
or the 8 bits per character that have become common on computers, Unicode uses a full 16 bits for character encoding. This
allows Unicode to represent all the letters, ideographs, and other symbols used in all the written languages of the world
that are likely to be used in computer communication.

### American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
ASCII, had it's origins in the late 1950s and was finalized in 1967. The American National Standards Institue (ANSI) documented
the ASCII coded character sets to be 7-bit in 1986. Below is a view of a ASCII table:
